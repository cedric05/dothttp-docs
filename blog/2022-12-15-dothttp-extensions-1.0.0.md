We are thrilled to announce the official release of dothttp-runner 1.0.0, marking a significant milestone since its initial introduction in February 2021. Over the past few months, our primary focus has been on addressing various bugs, and we believe the time has come to reach the 1.0 milestone.

As the sole developer and maintainer of this project, I take great pride in its progress, even though our user base remains modest, with fewer than 10 users. In my previous role, I was responsible for managing 10-20 microservices, each with its own set of APIs. Unfortunately, there were no dedicated clients or SDKs available to interact with these APIs. Using tools like curl was challenging due to the lack of convenient features for saving, updating, running, and sending requests. While Postman is widely used, I found it to be less developer-friendly and resource-intensive, making it less than ideal for my needs. This led to the creation of dothttp-runner, a tool designed to simplify and enhance the experience of working with HTTP requests, placing a strong emphasis on developer-friendliness.

Here are the key principles that have guided the development of dothttp-runner:

1. **Respect for Privacy:** We do not collect any user data or telemetry.
2. **Developer-Friendly:** Our goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for developers.
3. **Efficient Import/Export/Share:** Easily import, export, and share your requests.
4. **Seamless Integration:** Works harmoniously with your existing developer tools, including VS Code and the command line.
5. **Quick Start:** Get started with minimal setup and configuration.
6. **Save and Reuse:** A central focus on the ability to save and reuse HTTP requests.

Initially conceived as a command-line tool akin to curl, feedback from discussions with Postman and Insomnia users prompted the development of a VS Code extension. After our first release, we received valuable requests for features such as request history, variable support, managing multiple requests within a single file, and extending requests.

While the current usage of dothttp-runner has been encouraging, I must candidly acknowledge that dedicating further resources to its development is not currently a viable proposition, both from a professional and personal standpoint. However, I will continue to provide support in terms of bug fixes for the next 2-3 months, and this commitment is the driving force behind the decision to release version 1.0.0.
